# Dynamic-CSS

How to add dynamic CSS to a row using ZK  ?
As we are involvng in designing and developing new things almost everyday, 
while doing we may face many some UI issue, I want to share some concepts which I have implemented, 
I hope it may help to our team.

I assume I have a structure like this 
                       Listbox
                             table
                                tbody
                                    tr
                                      td
